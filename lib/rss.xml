 <br><br><br><br>You can write tasks almost everywhere in your vault using the ctrl+alt+Q shortcut, or simply typing a markdown task.<br>The excluded folder are :<br>_Sources -&gt; You don't want online links tasks to be shown as tasks
5-Templates -&gt; Template files are excluded as well
Copiar<br>The tasks will then be shown in the obsidian-tasks queries inside your daily and periodic notes.<br><br>A project is just a task enclosed in double brackets like that : [[TASK_NAME]].<br>Example :<br>- [ ] [[TASK_NAME]] ➕ 2023-05-07 📅 2024-01-31
Copiar<br>This way, you can create a project note by clicking on the task link. And add some tasks inside !<br>Projects are supposed to be created within an Area file of your choice in your 2-Areas folder. But there's no obligation, it just helps focusing on the right things.<br>Don't forget to move your projects notes to the 1-Projects folder for easier management.<br>!!! warning "There's the project markdown task, and there's the markdown note"<br>
The markdown tasks using the obsidian-tasks properties holds a note in place of the task.description. That means when a project is done, you should mark the task as done, and move the project note from the 1-Projects folder to the 4-Archives folder.<br><br>You can use the QuickAdd plugin to create a task or a project.<br>Simply click on the QuickAdd button Create Something in the left ribbon and select the type of task you want to create :<br>
<br>Create Project -&gt; Create a project in an Area file of your choice in your 2-Areas.
<br>Create One-Off Task -&gt; Create a task in the Notes part of today's daily note
<br>Someday Maybe -&gt; Create a list item in your Someday maybe inbox.
<br>Create Passion -&gt; Create a new passion/media in your Passions Backlog 🎮 kanban board
<br><br>You can import your todoist tasks using the Import from Todoist QuickAdd button in the left ribbon. You then just need to select the tasks you want.<br>This required to have the obsidian-todoist plugin configured. Please refer to the <a class="internal-link" data-href="../getting-started/installation.md#how-to-login-to-plugins" href="\getting-started\installation.html#how-to-login-to-plugins" target="_self" rel="noopener">installation instructions.</a><br>You'll have access to the same choices as the Create Something button, while also being able to :<br>
<br>Import selected Todoist tasks into your cursor position as well.
<br><br>
<br>One-off tasks : Tasks created in the Notes 📝 part of today's daily note are considered as one-off tasks, meaning tasks that are not part of a project.
<br>Project tasks : Tasks created in a project note are considered as project tasks, meaning tasks that are part of a project. To be fair, every tasks not in a daily-note are considered as project tasks.
<br>Focus 🔥 &amp; Goals 🎯 : Tasks created in the PERIOD Focus 🔥 &amp; Goals 🎯 section of a daily or periodic notes will be considered as stuff you want to focus on during the period, or goals you want to achieve.
<br>Passions Backlog 🎮 : Tasks created in the Passions Backlog 🎮 kanban board are considered as passion tasks, meaning medias to watch, play, read, etc.
<br>Someday maybe 💭 : Tasks created in the Someday maybe file are not really tasks but just list items. They will one day be moved to action somewhere.
<br><br>A task always have :<br>
<br>A status
<br>A task can have :<br>
<br>A created date
<br>A start date
<br>A scheduled date
<br>A due date
<br>A done date
<br>A cancelled date
<br>A reccurence rule
<br>A priority
<br>One or many tags (using the # symbol)
<br>Tags should come after the task.description and before the task.properties :<br>- [ ] TASK_NAME #tag1 #tag2 #tag3 PRIORITY_ICON 🔁 RECCURENCE_RULE ➕ CREATION_DATE OTHER DATES...
Copiar<br>GTD tags with associated queries in daily and periodic notes are :<br>
<br>#next for next actions -&gt; Other tags in the tasks are considered as contexts (eg: #next #computer will be considered as an action to do next when using a computer)
<br>#waiting for waiting for tasks
<br>#delegated for delegated tasks

 <br><br><br>The workflow is entirely inspired from the book Getting Things Done from David Allen. Here's a <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://todoist.com/productivity-methods/getting-things-done" rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="https://todoist.com/productivity-methods/getting-things-done" target="_blank">quick overview</a> :<br>
<br>Add items to the todoist inbox everytime you have an idea or a task to do. To cite David Allen, the creator of the GTD method, "Your mind is for having ideas, not holding them".
<br>Clarify and organize your inbox items and add them to the appropriate part of your vault (One-off tasks, projects, project tasks, passions items, someday maybe). Add tags, dates, and any relevant properties that will make you do it at the right time in the future or at least remember them.
<br>Engage with your tasks and projects by using your daily note to direct your actions. I personally pick my tasks from the Today ☀️ section of my daily note, and I copy them to Super Productivity. I then add an estimated time to each task and start working on them.
<br>Review your system periodicly to make sure you are on track and that you have not forgotten anything. I personally do it on Sunday evening.
<br><br>The Daily Note is the main part of your workflow. It has :<br>
<br>Links to access higher periods
<br>Links to access previous and next days
<br>Today ☀️ section -&gt; Contains tasks with a happens date set to today or before, or tasks in progress. Tasks are then grouped by projects or tasks, and by due or overdue. You also get a small #next actions querry.
<br>Notes 📝 section -&gt; For adding notes and tasks as one-off tasks.
<br>Inbox 📥 section -&gt; A simple todoist-inbox-query to see easily if you have <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://todoist.com/productivity-methods/getting-things-done#capture" rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="https://todoist.com/productivity-methods/getting-things-done#capture" target="_blank">captured</a> items to <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://todoist.com/productivity-methods/getting-things-done#clarify" rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="https://todoist.com/productivity-methods/getting-things-done#clarify" target="_blank">clarify and organize</a>.
<br>Dashboard 🗺️ section -&gt; Multiple queries to see overdue, do today, upcoming in the next 30 days, recurring tasks, next actions, projects,  waiting for tasks, delegated tasks, and your focus and goals.
<br>Passions 🎮 section -&gt; A query that get your current passions and media from your Passions Backlog 🎮 kanban board. It uses the Doing keyword in titles to get the current passions and media.
<br>Logs 🪵 section -&gt; A query that get your created tasks and projects as well as your tasks and projects done today.
<br>Daily Focus 🔥 &amp; Goals 🎯 section -&gt; Add your daily focuses and goals here as markdown tasks. A tag #focus or #goals is required.
<br>Journal 📓 section -&gt; Add your journal entries here. The mood inline field is a 1-5 notation for the day, from really bad (1) to genial day (5).
<br><br>You get almost the same sections as the daily notes, but you also have :<br>
<br>A <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://github.com/mathisgauthey/Obsidian-Tasks-Calendar" rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="https://github.com/mathisgauthey/Obsidian-Tasks-Calendar" target="_blank">modified Tasks-Calendar</a> in the Dashboard 🗺️ in the weekly and monthly notes.
<br>Underground 🚇 section -&gt; Queries that have projects grouped by areas, usefull when trying to balance workload. You also get the unplanned and on hold tasks and projects queries.

 <br><br><br>My templater plugin configuration uses the Filename-Template.md file to choose what to do with a file when it is created.<br>Basically, if it is created with a daily or periodic note title type, it will select the appropriate template and folder :<br>{ format: "YYYY-MM-DD", template: "Daily-Notes.md" },
{ format: "GGGG-[W]WW", template: "Weekly-Notes.md" },
{ format: "YYYY-MM", template: "Monthly-Notes.md" },
{ format: "YYYY-[Q]Q", template: "Quarterly-Notes.md" },
{ format: "YYYY", template: "Yearly-Notes.md" },
Copiar<br>If not, it will just use either the Area template or the default template for the inbox :<br>{ format: "Area", template: "Areas.md" },
{ format: "Default", template: "Untitled.md" },
